# Raytracing in one weekend

I decided to try to follow the "Raytracing in One Weekend" course by this guy named Peter Shirley. (Begun 29 Dec 2021).

I found the course here: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html.

Throughout the course of this project, I tried my best to code according to the descriptions of each function/class, starting from the function/class definitions.
